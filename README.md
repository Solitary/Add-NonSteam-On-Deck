# Add-NonSteam-On-Deck
GUI script allowing adding non-Steam apps while in gaming mode on Steam Deck. No need to switch to desktop mode anymore, no need to restart!

Main focus is on installed apps (Flatpaks) and other system applications, with easy way to look for shell scripts, executables (including Windows *.exe files).
Do not forget to enable comptability layer for given app when adding *.exe files. 

Script creates temporary directory to present all installed flatpaks and system apps in one place. This directory is refreshed everytime this script is run.
